## Notes

Mr. Mertic opened the meeting at 5:00 p.m. Central European Time.

Mr. Mertic reviewed the Antitrust Policy, TAC members, Review Schedule, and the Project Sponsors list.

Mr. Mertic asked attendees to provide guest speakers and topics for future TAC meetings.

Mr. Mertic shared the plan to move all projects over to using LFX PCC Meeting Management by the end of the year. Mr. Mertic asked for projects to volunteer to move over and indicated that in the coming weeks, any projects that still need to be moved over would be reached out to move over.

Mr. Mertic shared a topic on looking at Slack alternatives, with a specific issue opened around looking at Zulip. In general, TAC members liked Slack because it is a standard tool within their organizations, but they also saw it as a tool specifically for instant messaging. Mr. Ziegler asked if reviewing tools that could help support knowledge bases would be helpful; attendees generally agreed that it would. Mr. Mertic asked attendees to add tools to the referenced issue to be considered.

Ms. Teyber presented the GRIP Alliance proposal to the TAC. Questions were asked about potential alignment with projects such as SOGNO, OpenSTEF, and Power Grid Model; Ms. Teyber indicated that there has not been much research done, but it would be something the project would be open to. There were further questions about powerline robustness and distributed infrastructure. 

Mr. Mertic asked the TAC to approve GRIP Alliance as a Sandbox project. Mr. Monti made the motion, and Mr. Pope seconded the motion; all TAC voting members in attendance were in favor.

Mr. Muller presented the GXF annual review. There was recognition of GXF achieving it's OpenSSF Best Practices Silver Level badge.

Mr. Mertic asked the TAC to approve the renewal of GXF at the Early Adoption stage. Mr. Bogaard made the motion, and Mr. Dolley seconded the motion; all TAC voting members in attendance were in favor.

Mr. Parisot presented a proposal for an AI Working Group. There was general agreement that this would be a valuable working group to have. 

Mr. Mertic asked the TAC to approve the formation of the AI Working Group. Mr. Dolley made the motion, and Mr. Monti seconded the motion; all TAC voting members in attendance were in favor.

Mr. Brown presented marketing and PR updates. 

Mr. Mertic closed the meeting at 6:23 p.m. Central European Time.
